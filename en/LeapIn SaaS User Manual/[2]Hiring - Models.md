# Hiring - Models

To get started, head to the Model Management menu and click the "Add New Model" button in the upper right.

There are three ways to create a model:

1. Choose from our pre-built models in the question bank for instant deployment
2. Start with a template and customize the capabilities and questions to fit your needs
3. Build from scratch by naming your model and adding 4-6 custom questions

## Invite Employee

Once your model is set up, you can invite participants by either manually entering their information or uploading a template. They'll receive an email invitation to record a video for the modeling process. You can also share the invitation link directly in group chats.
